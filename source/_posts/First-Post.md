Ignoring the first 4 random things, this is the first post I publish on this test site. I used Hexo and deployed in on Heroku. With Hexo, the chocie of style is original CSS and the choice of template is EJS. 
I was going to use VuePress but I couldn't figure it out. I also give up the idea of writing my own using Vue.js, but I figure it might be a little hard to design the server on information storing and sorting/getting all the informations. At the same time, for the purpose right now, there is no need to make a dynamic website just for this static blog. I will eventually use Vue.js to make it and deploy it once I can figure how markdown to Vue and some formatting on dispalying the transfered markdown, more of the formatting part, this website also shows my lack of understanding on the formatting as well. But honestly, stylesheet is a painful thing to do for me.

Something to notice is that since I made my own theme, it is really incomplete as the code part will not hightlight at all, and some other issues.

I am too lazy to add tags and categories and those features are suppose to be in seperate tabs but I do not know how to add extra routes and make hexo use template for them instead of markdown. Either way, for now it is fine so I am happy. 

I usually wounldn't write a lot, and thought of not make a blog anymore, but whatever.
